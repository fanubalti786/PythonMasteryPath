# Strings
# Strings are data types that stores a squance of characters.

# Basic operation

# Concatination

#length of str
print(len(str1))

print(len(str3))

# the empty space is also part of length

# Indexing 
# we just access all indexes but we can't manupulate them means this ch1 = "@"

# Accessing part of a string

# Negative indexing in only python
